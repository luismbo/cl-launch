Description: uniform frontend to running Common Lisp code from the shell
 CL-Launch will allow you to invoke Common Lisp source code from the shell
 command line or from a shell script. It will also allow you to turn your
 Common Lisp source programs into standalone executables or executable shell
 scripts (optionally using a dumped image), depending on the features
 available in your underlying implementation.
 .
 CL-Launch will automatically detect a supported Common Lisp implementation
 and use adequate invocation options. It can also be configured to fit exactly
 the programmer's desires. Fully supported implementations are:
        Allegro, CLISP, ClozureCL, CMUCL, ECL, SBCL, SCL.
 Of these, SBCL, ECL and CLISP support creating standalone executables.
 Partially supported implementations are:
        LispWorks Professional, ABCL, GCL 2.6, GCL 2.7, XCL.
 .
 CL-Launch also offers Common Lisp programs a simple uniform interface to
 invocation parameters (command-line arguments and environment variables).
 It relies on ASDF 3 for system construction. See the ASDF 3 manual for
 more information on how to configure source and object code location.
 CL-Launch may dump memory images for fast startup (at the expense of disk
 space). It can also be used as a quick way to evaluate and print simple Lisp
 forms or scripts from the command-line without invoking a full-fledged REPL,
 and to easily compare results between implementations.
